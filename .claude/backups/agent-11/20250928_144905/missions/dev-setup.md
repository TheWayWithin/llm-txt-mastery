# Mission: Dev-Setup 🚀
## Greenfield Project Initialization

### Mission Type
**Initial Setup** - Foundation laying for new projects

### Estimated Duration
30-45 minutes

### Required Assets
- Ideation document (PRD, brand guidelines, architecture specs, vision doc)
- GitHub repository name/URL
- Project vision and goals

---

## Mission Briefing

This mission establishes the foundation for a new greenfield project by:
1. Setting up GitHub integration
2. Analyzing ideation documents
3. Creating initial project plan
4. Establishing progress tracking
5. Configuring CLAUDE.md for ongoing development

### Prerequisites
- AGENT-11 deployed to project
- Ideation document prepared
- GitHub repository created (or ready to create)

---

## Execution Protocol

### Phase 0: MCP Discovery (2 min)
```bash
/coord "Checking available MCPs for project setup..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @coordinator runs grep "mcp__" to identify available tools
- Documents available MCPs in project-plan.md
- Maps MCPs to project needs:
  - Database: mcp__supabase
  - Documentation: mcp__context7
  - Testing: mcp__playwright
  - Deployment: mcp__netlify, mcp__railway
- Notes which agents should use which MCPs

### Phase 1: GitHub Setup (5 min)
```bash
/coord "Let's set up this greenfield project. First, what's the GitHub repository URL or name for this project?"
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @coordinator prompts for GitHub details
- Initializes git if needed
- Sets up remote origin
- Creates initial commit structure

### Phase 2: Ideation Analysis (10 min)
```bash
/coord "Please share your ideation document - this could be a PRD, vision doc, brand guidelines, or architecture specs"
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @strategist analyzes ideation document
- Extracts key requirements
- Identifies technical constraints
- Maps business objectives
- Notes brand/design requirements

### Phase 3: Architecture Documentation (10 min)
```bash
/coord "Creating architecture documentation based on ideation and requirements..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @architect creates `architecture.md` using template:
  - System overview and boundaries
  - Infrastructure architecture
  - Application architecture
  - Data architecture
  - Integration points
  - Architecture decisions
  - Current limitations
  - Next steps

**Note**: Uses `/templates/architecture.md` as starting point
**Reference**: See `/project/field-manual/architecture-sop.md` for comprehensive guidelines

### Phase 4: Project Planning (15 min)
```bash
/coord "Creating initial project plan based on ideation analysis and architecture..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @strategist creates `project-plan.md` with:
  - Executive summary
  - Core objectives
  - Technical architecture (referencing architecture.md)
  - Milestone roadmap
  - Success metrics
  - Risk assessment
  - Resource requirements

**project-plan.md Structure:**
```markdown
# Project Plan

| Risk 1 | High | Strategy |
| Risk 2 | Medium | Strategy |

## Dependencies
- [ ] Dependency 1
- [ ] Dependency 2
```

### Phase 5: Progress Tracking Setup (5 min)
```bash
/coord "Setting up progress tracking system..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @documenter creates `progress.md`:

**progress.md Structure:**
```markdown
# Project Progress Log

## Overview
Project Start Date: [DATE]
Last Updated: [DATE]

## Completed Milestones
_None yet - just getting started!_

## Current Sprint
### Goals
- [ ] Goal 1
- [ ] Goal 2
- [ ] Goal 3

### Blockers
_None currently_

## Lessons Learned
_To be updated as we progress_

## Technical Decisions
_Key architectural and implementation decisions will be logged here_

## Performance Insights
_Optimization opportunities and performance wins_
```

### Phase 6: CLAUDE.md Configuration (10 min)
```bash
/coord "Updating CLAUDE.md with project-specific instructions..."
```

**Agent Actions:**
- @coordinator updates CLAUDE.md with:
  - Project overview from ideation
  - Available MCPs and their usage
  - Tracking requirements
  - Performance insights section
  - Update protocols

**CLAUDE.md Additions:**
```markdown
## Project Overview
[Extracted from ideation document]

## Available MCPs
[Discovered MCPs and their assigned usage]
- mcp__supabase: Database operations (@developer, @operator)
- mcp__context7: Documentation (@all agents)
- mcp__playwright: Testing (@tester)
- mcp__firecrawl: Research (@architect, @developer)
- [Additional MCPs as discovered]

## Ideation Context
Location: `./ideation.md` (or specified location)
Key Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

## Progress Tracking Protocol
After each work session or milestone:
1. Update `project-plan.md` with completed tasks and MCPs used
2. Log issues and resolutions in `progress.md`
3. Document lessons learned
4. Record performance insights
5. Note successful MCP usage patterns

## Performance Insights
[To be updated with optimization opportunities]

## Update Checklist
- [ ] Milestone completed → Update project-plan.md
- [ ] Issue resolved → Log in progress.md
- [ ] Lesson learned → Add to progress.md
- [ ] Performance insight → Update CLAUDE.md
- [ ] MCP pattern discovered → Document usage
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Ideation Document:**
- Work with user to create basic requirements
- Use @strategist to help structure vision

**Unclear Requirements:**
- @strategist conducts discovery session
- Creates preliminary PRD from discussion

**GitHub Not Ready:**
- Guide through repository creation
- Offer to initialize locally first
